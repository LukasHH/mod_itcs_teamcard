Display your team with this module.

Select the colours and style in the backend and create up to 20 team cards in one module. The links can be set individually for each card, as can the alignment of the image.

The module and the animations do not need javascript, because the effects are made of CSS3. The style and CSS script is a free resource from jomla51.com.


## Responsive display:
When viewed on smaller devices such as smartphones, the team cards are displayed in portrait format. The image with the links is at the top and the text block follows below the image.
